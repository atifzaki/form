<h1><i><b>Company Profile</b></i></h1><br/>
<p>The Cnergyico Group was founded by its Founder and first Chairman, Mr. Parvez Abbasi in the mid-90s with the vision to pioneer change in Pakistan’s energy sector. Cnergyico Pk Limited was formed in January 1995 as public limited company.

  Cnergyico installed its first oil refinery with a 30,000-barrels-a-day capacity at Mouza Kund, Hub Balochistan, and began commercial production on 1 July 2004 producing liquefied petroleum gas, light naphtha, heavy naphtha, high-octane blending component, motor gasoline, kerosene, jet fuels, high speed diesel, and furnace oil
  
  The company ventured into the petroleum marketing business in 2008, setting up its first retail outlet, the retail network has since seen exponential growth currently having more than 400 outlets nationwide.
  
  After successful establishment of the first refinery, the group decided to establish a 120,000-barrels-a-day refinery in 2008 and bought an aromatic plant for future implementation.
  
  In February 2008, a leading private equity firm of the MENASA region (Middle East North Africa and South Asia), took a significant minority equity stake in Cnergyico.
  
  In 2012, Cnergyico successfully commissioned the largest refinery in the country. This new refinery was installed near the existing refinery and has a capacity of 120,000 barrels a day, bringing Cnergyico’s total installed refining capacity to 156,000 barrels per day, the highest in all of Pakistan today.
  
  That same year, Cnergyico achieved another milestone by successfully commissioning Pakistan’s first and only Single Point Mooring (SPM). This floating port is located 13 km offshore in the Arabian Sea near Charna Island. Cnergyico’s SPM has the capacity to handle very large petroleum cargo vessels (VLCC’s), and gives Cnergyico a distinctive competitive strategic advantage in Pakistan’s petroleum industry.
  
  Cnergyico manages more than a quarter of all petroleum sold in Pakistan and is the nation’s only vertically integrated Oil Company.</p><br/>
